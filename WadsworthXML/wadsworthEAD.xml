            <abstract>The Wadsworth Collections concern the first and continued settlement of land
                in the Genesee region known as the Phelps and Gorham Purchase. The collections
                consist of approximately 50,000 items from the land offices of the two branches of
                the Wadsworth family of Geneseo and cover the years 1790 to about 1950, with most
                dating from the 19th century. Business correspondence and ledgers, vouchers, deeds,
                maps and other business-related materials make up most of the collections. Milne's
                collection does not include official papers from the terms of Congressman James W.
                Wadsworth (1846-1926) or U.S. Senator James. W. Wadsworth, Jr. (1877-1952). The
                Library of Congress is home to <archref href="http://lcweb2.loc.gov/service/mss/eadxmlmss/eadpdfmss/1997/ms997014.pdf" show="new" actuate="onrequest">The James Wadsworth Family Papers</archref>, a collection of
                personal and business materials which includes a large portion dealing with the
                Senator.

            <head>Overview</head>
            <p>Jeremiah Wadsworth (1743-1804) of Hartford, Connecticut was one of the financiers of
                the American Revolution. At the end of the war, he, like many other contemporaries,
                bought land in Western New York State as an investment. His holdings lay mainly on
                the east bank of the Genesee River, between Geneseo and Rochester, in what was known
                as Phelps and Gorham's Purchase. Also, like many others, he did not occupy the land
                himself, but sent agents to administer or sell the holdings. In the case of
                Jeremiah, he convinced his two nephews, William Wadsworth (1761-1833) and James
                Wadsworth (1768-1844) to leave the comforts of Durham, Connecticut and settle in
                this wilderness. His persuasion was to offer them the chance to buy some of the
                choicest land at cost. In return, they were to oversee the sale of the rest of his
                holdings. William oversaw the development of the family farm, and James administered
                the land sales and leases. </p>
            <p>William, who never married, was the sole year round resident in the first decade.
                James preferred to winter in more comfortable situations until after his marriage in
                1804. At times he traveled in Europe, where he met and agreed to be agent for other
                landholders in the area, such as Sir William Pulteney from England and the Six
                family of the Hague. James' marriage produced three daughters and two sons. Daughter
                Elizabeth (1815-1851) was James' housekeeper and hostess for his guests after the
                death of his wife in 1831. In 1841, James divided his estate and responsibility for
                land management between his two sons, William Wolcott Wadsworth (1810-1852) and
                James Samuel Wadsworth (1807-1864). </p>
            <p>This division of lands and responsibilities is reflected in the collection in
                important ways. James S. Wadsworth opened a land office at Number 1 Main Street to
                administer his part of the estate, and William Wolcott Wadsworth took over the
                Homestead office for management of his share of the holdings. When descendants of
                the two branches of the family gave the papers to Milne Library, it was stipulated
                that the papers should not be combined. </p>
            <p>Books and registers that were originally found together in the Homestead Office in
                numerical sequence were separated, and researchers must use materials in both
                collections for continuity in some subject areas. The same situation applies to the
                Map Collection. Each office housed the maps that applied to its specific holdings.
                In the map case, there are two separate collections alphabetized by township name.
                It may be necessary to search both collections for the complete picture. </p>
            <p>Three other events impacted the collection as it now stands. The first was the family
                decision to pack up most of the records from 1790 to 1838 and put them in storage.
                They have not been located by anyone in recent years, and may have been destroyed in
                one of the numerous barn fires that plagued the family from time to time. However,
                one important letter book remains from the second decade of the nineteenth century,
                and a collection of early family papers was given to the Library of Congress by the
                descendants of General James S. Wadsworth. These are available on microfilm in Milne
                Library. Orsamus Turner in his history of Phelps and Gorham's Purchase quotes from
                missing early records that he had read. </p>
            <p>The other two events were the premature deaths of both of James Wadsworth's sons and
                heirs. William Wolcott died in 1851 after falling on ice. He left his wife Emmeline
                and two very young sons, William Austin Wadsworth (1847-1918), and Herbert Wadsworth
                (1851-1930) as heirs to his estate. Emmeline was not overly fond of living in
                Geneseo, and after her husband's death spent more and more time in Boston near her
                family and friends in the arts and letters. She was travelling in Europe when the
                Civil War broke out. She turned over all the business matter to clerks,
                housekeepers, and lawyers in Geneseo and Boston for almost twenty years. </p>
            <p>General James S. Wadsworth was killed in the Civil War Battle of the Wilderness in
                1864. His eldest son, James Wolcott Wadsworth was only 18, so the affairs at Number
                1 Main Street were also administered by clerks and attorneys for some years. It may
                be helpful for one to remember that the proprietors of the Homestead were all named
                William after father James' death in 1844, and the proprietors at Number 1 Main
                street were all named James. There was only one brief exception. General James' son
                Craig Wharton Wadsworth (1841-1872) owned the Homestead for two year 1870-1871 but
                because of ill health, he sold it back to William Wolcott's son William Austin
                Wadsworth. William's mother Emmeline returned to Geneseo to live with him at the
                Homestead after it had been moved back from the street and remodeled around 1875. </p>
            <p>Both William Wolcott and James S. Wadsworth had invested in extensive land holdings
                in Ohio and Michigan. Part of the correspondence concerns these lands and the agents
                who administered them. There are also photo albums containing pictures taken by
                Herbert's wife Martha Blow Wadsworth (1864-1934). Both branches of the family were
                involved in local, state and national politics. William Austin Wadsworth (1847-1918)
                was a friend and comrade in arms of Theodore Roosevelt and served him when he was
                Governor in Albany, but he would not leave Geneseo for Washington. His son William
                Perkins Wadsworth (1906-1982) also elected to remain in Geneseo and local politics.
                However, James Wolcott (1846-1926) was a Congressman; his son James Wolcott, Jr.
                (1877-1952) was a Senator; and his grandson James Jeremiah Wadsworth (1905-1984) was
                Ambassador to the United Nations. </p>
            <note>
                <p>The above is an overview of the collection. A more detailed description follows
                    in the registers for various facets of the collection. If one wishes to read a
                    further account of the Wadsworth family, see the chapter entitled "The
                    Wadsworths of Geneseo" in Irene Beale's book <emph render="italic">Genesee Valley People</emph>. It is
                    followed by a good bibliography of other sources. </p>

                    <p>Most of the Wadsworth maps are manuscript maps drawn by surveyors or copied
                        from other originals for the use of the family. They are seldom dated, but
                        internal evidence indicates that some date back to before 1800. This is
                        especially true of the tract maps for both the Holland Purchase and the
                        Phelps and Gorham Purchase. The names of settlers who leased or bought
                        the lots has been written on most of the maps, and they are a good place to
                        start a search for family residence in western New York. Following is a list
                        of multiple or single lot maps by Township, Tract, County or Indian
                        Reservation in the two collections. </p>

                    <note>
                        <p>The strength of this collection lies in the fact that it gives a picture
                            of the tastes and life of one of the area's most important families over
                            a century that spanned the time from frontier life to the industrial
                            revolution and beyond. It is also a graphic illustration of the history
                            of business printing and practices in the United States. As with the
                            letters, more personal expenses gradually disappeared, perhaps because
                            of the crises that the family experienced, or that they were not later
                            kept by the office clerk. When Emmeline and son William Austin returned
                            to live in the Homestead, personal vouchers were boxed separately.</p>

                        <p>Contracts before 1840 are few and far between. After 1840 leases were
                            made for one year and were renewable. Land sales were registered at the
                            County Court House. Some copies can be found in the Deed Books (See <emph render="italic">Deeds</emph> Section). </p>

                    <p>Genealogists are often interested in proving that an ancestor was a tenant on
                        a Wadsworth farm. Searching the core collection and other documents listed
                        on the previous page can be tedious. There are in the first three contract
                        boxes blue sheets that have the names of the tenants listed in calendars.
                        Except for a very few leases as early as 1814, these records cover the
                        1830's and 1840's. Beginning in box C4 for 1852 and through and including
                        the year 1860, there are folders entitle "Cash and Wheat Rents." These
                        documents list the tenants and the farm or portion of farm which they rented
                        in this decade. </p>
                    <p>The tenants in all these guides are listed by townships, in the immediate
                        Genesee Region. The majority of rented lands were in Avon. In the early
                        years the Wadsworths issued long-term lease agreements. However, after 1838,
                        most every lease is for one year. The family also allowed renters to pay
                        part of their bill in wheat which they would deliver to a Wadsworth mill for
                        credit. This was known as the "corn rent," a practice they learned about from
                        friends in Scotland. </p>

                    <p>Western New York originally was one county called Ontario from which land
                        west of the river was split off into a Genesee County. About 1820, Ontario
                        and Genesee were split into counties that we know today. Supposedly copies
                        of deeds were given to each new county as it was formed for the lots that it
                        contained. The Wadsworths found it convenient to have their own copies in
                        the land offices.</p>

                    <p>Below is a list of places where the Wadsworth family or their agents were
                        named as grantors or grantees on deeds. All of the deeds should be
                        registered in the appropriate County Court House, but in case one should
                        wish to locate copies in this collection, one should refer to the two drawer
                        card file for the box or book in which they are available. All the locations

                        <p>These letters concern the business and home life of the occupants of the
                            Homestead at the south end of Main Street. Until the death of William
                            Wolcott Wadsworth in 1852 they were more descriptive and anecdotal.
                            After that the collection was kept up by the designated clerks and
                            agents and contains fewer personal or family letters. The later letters
                            refer mostly to business expenses. The first twenty boxes are provided
                            with calendars for each folder. Of special interest to historians are
                            Elizabeth Wadsworth's letters to her brother William Wolcott Wadsworth
                            describing life in Geneseo while he was away from home. As mentioned
                            above, letters before 1837 can be found on the microfilm from the
                            Library of Congress. Also note the first letter book in the following
                            section for 1815 to 1819. </p>

                    <p>Letter books were the nineteenth century method for keeping copies of letters
                        that one wrote to friends or for business matters. There was no carbon paper
                        or photo copying device to duplicate and preserve such information. With
                        some overlap and some gaps in coverage, the following books are in

                    <p>One small book contains both a list and a ledger of accounts with workers.
                        other books have a list at the beginning and then the managers diary of work
                        assignments for the period, and one book was used as a payroll, the workers
                        being asked to sign it every time they were payed for any work. The notes on
                        work assignments are like a calendar and narrative of what happened on a
                        Wadsworth farm. </p>

                    <p>Farm labor did not usually live on the Wadsworth farms except on the flats,
                        where there was for a time a dormitory and boarding house for single
                        workers. The women who worked at the boarding house are also included in
                        these lists. One very good reason for no housing for families on the flats
                        was the annual flooding that occurred every year until the Mt. Morris Dam
                        was built around 1950. Working men in the Genesee Valley lived in the
                        villages and on high ground. They went out to work the farm land in the
                        valley much as was the custom in Europe. Uninformed travelers, sometimes
                        criticized the Wadsworths for practicing a form of peonage in this regard,
                        when they saw no family housing on the flats.</p>
                    <p>William Wadsworth (1761-183) was notorious for being a hard boss. When an
                        acquaintance asked his brother James to take on a son and teach him farming,
                        James discouraged the gentleman of any such notion, and advised him to send
                        the boy elsewhere. William had died by the time these lists were made, but
                        the farm managers, no doubt, carried on the work much as their former boss
                        had done. His nephews William Wolcott and James S., who took over management
                        of the farms in the following years, were praised by those who knew them for
                        their enlightened and scientific farm practices. They were admirers of farm
                        practices in Scotland and adopted some Scottish ways, such as "corn rent,"
                        payment with part of one's crop. </p>
